    /// This is useful when, for example, when you have a sequence that itself emits observable
    /// sequences, and you want to be able to react to new emissions from either sequence. The difference
    /// between `flatMap` and `flatMapLatest` is that `flatMapLatest` will only emit elements from the most recent
    /// inner sequence. [More info](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/flatmap.html)

    /// - Parameter transform: A transform function to apply to each element.
    ///
    /// - Returns: An observable sequence whose elements are the result of invoking the transform function on each element of source producing an
    ///            observable of observable sequences and that at any point in time produces the elements of the most recent inner observable sequence that has been received.
