The *CombineRx* library contains a series of functions that help with the interoperability between [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) and Apple's [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) frameworks. It also provides some additional Combine utility and convenience operators that are not readily available out-of-the-box. The overall *CombineRx* library is made up of 3 components; *CombineRxInteroperability*, *CombineRxUtility*, and *CombineRxTest*. Descriptions of each can be found below: 

## *CombineRxInteroperability*: Interoperability between Combine and RxSwift

### Combine to RxSwift
In order to convert Combine `Publisher`s to RxSwift  `Observable`s, you can make use of the `asObservable()` function. This can be done as follows:
```swift
import Combine
import RxSwift
import CombineRx

let myBridgedObservable = Just(0).asObservable()
```

### RxSwift to Combine
In order to convert RxSwift `Observable`s to Combine `Publisher`s, you can make use of the
`asPublisher(withBufferSize:andBridgeBufferingStrategy:)` function. This can be done as follows:
```swift
import Combine
import RxSwift
import CombineRx

let myBridgedPublisher1 = Observable.just(0).asPublisher(withBufferSize: 1, andBridgeBufferingStrategy: .error)
let myBridgedPublisher2 = Observable.from([0, 1, 2, 3]).asPublisher(withBufferSize: 4, andBridgeBufferingStrategy: .error)
```

One difference between RxSwift and Combine is that Combine adheres to the mechanism of backpressure in order to ensure that `Publisher`s only produce as many elements that `Subscriber`s have requested. This prevents the case where elements might build up in a `Publisher`s buffer faster than they can be processed downstream by a subscriber as this could lead to out-of-memory errors and degradation in performance due to high system resource consumption. Combine applies this backpressure upstream through a contractual obligation by `Publisher`s to only emit an element when it is requested by `Subscriber`s through `Subscribers.Demand` requests.

RxSwift `Observable`s differ in this regard as they rely on a source with an unbounded rate of production and therefore when bridging to a Combine `Publisher`, we must maintain a buffer or drop elements accordingly in order to satisfy the requirements of downstream subscribers.

This is the reason for the required `withBufferSize` and `andBridgeBufferingStrategy` parameters for `asPublisher(withBufferSize:andBridgeBufferingStrategy:)`. `withBufferSize` is where the buffer size should manually be set (ideally based directly on the number of expected elements in the sequence). `andBridgeBufferingStrategy` is the strategy to employ when the maximum buffer capacity is reached. Keeping in line with native Combine strategies, this can either be `error`, where any buffer overflow is treated as an error, `dropNewest` where the elements already present in the buffer are maintained and any new elements are ignored, or finally `dropOldest` where new elements are added to the buffer and replace older elements that were already present.

Additional information on Combine's use of backpressure can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/processing-published-elements-with-subscribers).

## *CombineRxUtility*: Combine Utility and Convenience Operators

Provides additional utility operators for use with Combine.

The added utility operators are as follows:
- `flatMapLatest`: Returns an observable sequence whose elements are the result of invoking the transform function on each element of source producing an observable of observable sequences and that at any point in time produces the elements of the most recent inner observable sequence that has been received.
- `withPrevious`: Returns an observable sequence containing the previous and current values as a tuple.
- `delaySubscription`: Time shifts an observable sequence by delaying the subscription with the specified relative time duration, using the specified scheduler to run timers.
- `withLatestFrom`: Merges two observable sequences into one observable sequence by combining each element from self with the latest element from the second source, if any.

The added convenience operators are as follows:
- `asResult`: Converts a publisher's output and failure type to a result that can be switched on. The resulting publisher's error type becomes `Never` as any error will be caught and propagated to the `Result`.
- `just(_:)`: A convenience method on `AnyPublisher` to create a `Just` without having to include the boilerplate code to set failure type and erase to `AnyPublisher`.
- `fail(with:)`: A convenience method on `AnyPublisher` to create a `Fail` without having to include the boilerplate code to set failure type and erase to `AnyPublisher`.

## *CombineRxTest*: Bringing RxTest to Combine

Coming soon...

## Installation

It is currently possible to install this library using Swift Package Manager. In order to do so, please add the current repository as a package dependency using Xcode or include the following in your `Package.swift` file:
```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/Jackstone92/CombineRx", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0")),
    ],
    ...
    targets: [
        .target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: ["CombineRx"]),
    ]
)
```
