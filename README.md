# CombineRxBridge

The *CombineRxBridge* library contains a series of functions that help with the interoperability between [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) and Apple's [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) frameworks.  

## Combine to RxSwift
In order to convert Combine `Publisher`s to RxSwift  `Observable`s, you can make use of the `asRxBridge()` function. This can be done as follows:
```swift
import Combine
import RxSwift
import CombineRxBridge

let myBridgedObservable = Publishers.Just<Int, Never>(0).asRxBridge()
```

## RxSwift to Combine
In order to convert RxSwift `Observable`s to Combine `Publisher`s, you can make use of the
`asCombineBridge(withBufferSize:andBridgeBufferingStrategy:)` function. This can be done as follows:
```swift
import Combine
import RxSwift
import CombineRxBridge

let myBridgedPublisher1 = Observable.just(0).asCombineBridge(withBufferSize: 1, andBridgeBufferingStrategy: .error)
let myBridgedPublisher2 = Observable.from([0, 1, 2, 3]).asCombineBridge(withBufferSize: 4, andBridgeBufferingStrategy: .error)
```

One difference between RxSwift and Combine is that Combine adheres to the mechanism of back pressure in order to ensure that `Publisher`s only produce as many elements that `Subscriber`s have requested. This prevents the case where elements might build up in a `Publisher`s buffer faster than they can be processed downstream by a subscriber as this could lead to out-of-memory errors and degradation in performance due to high system resource consumption. Combine applies this back pressure upstream through a contractual obligation by `Publisher`s to only emit an elements when they are requested by `Subscriber`s through `Subscribers.Demand` requests.

RxSwift `Observable`s differ in this regard as they rely on a source with an unbounded rate of production and therefore when bridging to a Combine `Publisher`, we must maintain a buffer or drop elements accordingly in order to satisfy the requirements of downstream subscribers.

This is the reason for the required `withBufferSize` and `andBridgeBufferingStrategy` parameters for `asCombineBridge(withBufferSize:andBridgeBufferingStrategy:)`. `withBufferSize` is where the buffer size should manually be set (ideally based directly on the number of expected elements in the sequence). `andBridgeBufferingStrategy` is the strategy to employ when the maximum buffer capacity is reached. Keeping in line with native Combine strategies, this can either be `error`, where any buffer overflow is treated as an error, `dropNewest` where the elements already present in the buffer are maintained and any new elements are ignored, or finally `dropOldest` where new elements are added to the buffer and replace older elements that were already present.

Additional information on Combine's use of back pressure can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/processing-published-elements-with-subscribers).

## Installation

It is currently possible to install this library using Swift Package Manager. In order to do so, please add the current repository as a package dependency using Xcode or include the following in your `Package.swift` file:
```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/Jackstone92/CombineRxBridge", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0")),
    ],
    ...
    targets: [
        .target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: ["CombineRxBridge"]),
    ]
)
```
